# Geometrical-Fight
My geomtry wars's ripp off :P

This project is a game I had in mind for a while but never really got to it...

This game is my revision of Geomtry Wars. I really like this game but I always found that the gameplay was a bit too simple and could have more depth, be more fun. That's why I got the pretty basic idea to add to this game a RPG component, with XP and skills, making worth all this die and retry XD (beside just scoring). Also adding more features to the gameplay than just shooting.

Core Gameplay:

The main idea is that the ship has 4 different forms you can alternate with. These forms are: Agressive, Defensive, Speedy and Sneaky. Each form changes how the ship behave and what ability it can use. There is 4 specific abilities per form: a passive, a active upon changing form, a modification of the main weapon and a special ability.

Agressive form:
-Passive: Increased damage
-Active: Area blast arround the ship
-Main weapon: two row of projectiles
-Special: Temporaly increased fire rate

Defensive form:
-Passive: Take less damage
-Active: Temporary shield
-Main weapon: Add life steal
-Special: Can't move, increased life steal

Speedy form:
-Passive: Increased speed 
-Active: Speed boost
-Main weapon: Twice as fast
-Special: Teleportation on a short distance

Sneaky form:
-Passive: Smaller size
-Active: Pass through enemies, can't shoot
-Main weapon: bouncing projectiles
-Special: Create a decoy 

To switch between form, use special ability or even to keep the form, the ship need energy. Energy can be found when destroying enemies.
