# Geometrical-Fight
My geomtry wars's ripp off :P

This project is a game I had in mind for a while but never really got to it...

This game is my revision of Geomtry Wars. I really like this game but I always found that the gameplay was a bit too simple and could have more depth and more fun in the gameplay. That's why I got the pretty basic idea to add to this game a RPG component, with XP and skills, making worth all this die and retry XD (beside just scoring).
